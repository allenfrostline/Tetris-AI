This is a rework of a simple Tetris game written by Kevin Chabowski. A range
of simple heuristics are fed to the AI and by default the AI will play at
the beginning. The original AI was spread on the Internet with no specific
author, to which I've done several improvements.

Control keys (slightly different from Kevin's original ones):
         P - Toggle the instant mode for AI
         Q - Exit the whole game
Left/Right - Move left or right
    Escape - Quit this round of game
    Return - Manual instant drop
     Space - Replay the game
